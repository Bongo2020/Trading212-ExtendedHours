## Trading 212 Extended-Hours Price Googler
This is a simple Python script used for looking up the pre-market and after-hours price action on your Trading 212 holdings.

### Motivation

Annoyingly, Trading 212 does not show stock price action in the extended hours sessions in markets such as the US. Luckily, Google does show this price action. So let's automate this search! 

### Getting started

All you need to do is insert your username and password into the prices.py file:

Then run the `prices.py` and it will complete a Google search of every holding on your Trading212 account.
